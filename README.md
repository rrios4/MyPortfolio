# My Portfolio
This is a portfolio that was used to documents all the material we learned and also attaching assignments we did to show what we learned. This was the final project for CIS 2336.
I learned the basics of HTML/CSS. SQL, Javascript and Perl while making this personalied page that I designed for myself that looked good to me and it was good experince that got my feet into web development thanks to this project.
